        <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled San Marzano plum tomatoes, crushed by hand</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon fine salt, plus more for pasta cooking water</li>

        <li>1 (16-ounce) package spaghetti</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="centered">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high. Add 4 slices bacon, chopped and cook, stirring often, until most of the fat has rendered and the bacon is starting to brown, about 5 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add 1 yellow onion, finely chopped, 1 large carrot, finely chopped (about 1/2 cup), 1 large celery stalk, finely chopped (about 1/2 cup), 3 medium cloves garlic, finely chopped, and 2 teaspoons salt-free dried Italian seasoning. Cook, stirring often, until softened but not browned, about 8 minutes. Scrape the onion mixture into a small bowl.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil to the Dutch oven over high heat. Add 1 pound ground chuck and 1 pound ground pork. Using a wooden spoon, break the meat mixture into large chunks to cover the bottom of the Dutch oven. Cook, undisturbed, until deeply browned on the bottom side, 8 to 10 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Reduce the heat to medium-high. Add 3 tablespoons tomato paste and cook, stirring and breaking up the meat into smaller pieces with a wooden spoon, until cooked through, about 3 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Stir the reserved onion mixture into the cooked beef mixture. Add 1 cup dry red wine and cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the wine has evaporated, about 6 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add 2 cups chicken stock, 1 1/2 cups whole milk, 1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled San Marzano plum tomatoes, crushed by hand, and 1/2 teaspoon fine salt. Bring to a simmer over medium-high. Reduce heat to its lowest setting, and very gently simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is thickened and creamy, 1 hour 45 minutes to 2 hours, skimming fat from the surface occasionally. Remove from the heat and gradually stir in 1 cup (4 ounces) parmesan cheese, grated.</p></li>
        <li><p>Remove 3 cups Bolognese from the pot and reserve for another time (it freezes really well). Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high and salt the water generously. Add 1 (16-ounce) package spaghetti, and cook according to package directions for al dente.</p></li>
        <li><p>While the pasta cooks, ladle 1 cup pasta cooking liquid into the Bolognese in the Dutch oven. Transfer the cooked spaghetti to the sauce in the pot. Place over medium-high heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the pasta is coated in the sauce, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt.</p></li>
